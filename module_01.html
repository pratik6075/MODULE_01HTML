        <strong>
            <li>are the html tags and elements same thing?</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Answer:-  No,Because HTML tags are simple instructions that tell a web browser how to format text,and HTML
        Elements are the on-page content sandwiched within the tags.</p>
        <strong>
            <li>what are tags and attributtes in html?</li>
        </strong> 
        <p>Answer:-  While HTML tags are simple instructions that tell a web browser how to format text, HTML attributes contain
        additional information about on-page elements.</p> 
        <strong>
            <li>What are void elements in HTML?</li>
        </strong> 
        <p>Answer:-  A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes).
        Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.</p>
        <strong>
              <li>What are HTML Entities?</li>
        </strong> 
        <p>Answer:-  An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon (
        ; ). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as
        HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).</p>
        <strong>
             <li>What are different types of lists in HTML?</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Answer:-  HTML Lists are used to specify lists of information. All lists may contain one or more list elements. There
        are three different types of HTML lists:</p>
        <ol>
        <li class="inlineList">Ordered List (ol)</li>
        <li class="inlineList">Unordered List (ul)</li>
        <li class="inlineList">Description List (dl)</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>
              <li> What is the &#8216; class &#8217; attribute in HTML?</li>
        </strong>
        <p>Answer:-  The HTML class attribute is used to specify a single or multiple class names for an HTML element. The class
        name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to do some tasks for HTML elements.</p>
        <strong>
            <li> What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML 
            elements? </li>
        </strong>
        <p>  Difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must
        only be used by one HTML element within the page.</p>
        <strong>
              <li>What are the various formatting tags in HTML? </li>
        </strong>
        <p> HTML provides many predefined elements that are used to change the formatting of text. The formatting can be
        used to set the text styles (like bold, italic, or emphasized, etc.), highlighting the text, making text
        superscript and subscript, etc.</p>
